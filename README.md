# Example Xcode project for iOS Tutorials

This project demonstrates how to integrate and use the **mimik Client Library** in an iOS app.  
It includes UI buttons and prewired Swift functions that let you interact with:  

- The **mimik Developer Console** (authentication, app management, token issuance)  
- The **mim OE runtime** (start, stop, reset, lifecycle management)  
- **Edge microservices** (deploy, list, update, call, undeploy)  

It is meant to be a practical companion to the tutorials on [mimik devdocs](https://devdocs.mimik.com/tutorials/01-submenu/02-submenu).

# Technical Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:  

- An actual iOS device running the **latest iOS version** (simulator support is limited, see below).  
- A Mac with the **latest version of Xcode** installed.  
- A [mimik Developer Console](https://console.mimik.com) account with a valid **runtime (Edge) License**.  

---

# Getting the Source Code

Clone this repo and open the project in Xcode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mimikgit/iOS-devdocs-example-01.git
```

---

# Opening the Xcode Project

The project uses CocoaPods for dependency management.  

We‚Äôve included the required libraries (`EdgeCore` and `mim-OE-ai-SE-iOS-developer`) in the `Podfile`.

### Step 1: Go to the project directory

```bash
cd iOS-devdocs-example-01
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

### Step 3: Open the workspace

```bash
open example.xcworkspace
```

### Step 4: Add your runtime license

Go to the [mimik Developer Console](https://console.mimik.com) and copy your **runtime (Edge) license**.  
In `ContentView.swift`, replace the placeholder:

```swift
private static let runtimeLicense = "{ADD-YOUR-RUNTIME-LICENSE-HERE}"
```

with your actual license value.  

For details, see the tutorial:  
üëâ [Getting the mim OE license and Identity server values](https://devdocs.mimik.com/tutorials/01-submenu/01-submenu/02-index)

### Step 5: Run on a real device

Connect an iOS device, build, and run the app in Xcode.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project requires a real iOS device.  
> The mimik Client Libraries have limitations when running inside the Simulator.  
> See the [iOS Simulator support tutorial](https://devdocs.mimik.com/tutorials/01-submenu/02-submenu/03-index#workingwithaniossimulator) for more info.

# Example Features

The sample UI exposes many core operations as buttons.  

Here are some highlights:

### Developer Console actions
- **Login** with your developer account  
- **Create**, **list**, or **delete** apps  
- **Get ID Tokens** and **Shared Tokens**  
- **Manage all apps** (‚ö†Ô∏è includes "delete all apps" functionality ‚Äî use with care)

### Runtime lifecycle
- **Start / Stop / Reset** the runtime  
- **Check runtime info**  
- **Manage lifecycle automatically**  
- **Activate external runtime** (e.g. on another host/device)  

### Edge Microservices
- **Deploy microservices** (example `randomnumber-v1.tar` is included)  
- **List deployed services**  
- **Call a microservice endpoint** (`/randomNumber`)  
- **Update environment variables**  
- **Undeploy services**

# Tips for Developers

- **Enable logging**: The project sets mimik Client Library logging to `.debug` for easier troubleshooting.  
- **App cleanup**: If you experiment heavily, consider using the **delete all apps** button ‚Äî but remove the `fatalError` guard first.  
- **Microservice images**: To deploy your own services, replace `randomnumber_v1.tar` with your own `.tar` image and update the config accordingly.  
- **Runtime license management**: You can switch between local and external runtimes by using the `activateExternalRuntime()` helper.

Happy experimenting! üöÄ  
ggThis project is your sandbox for learning how to interact with mimik runtimes, the developer console, and edge microservices directly from an iOS app ‚Äî while following along with the official [mimik tutorials](https://devdocs.mimik.com/tutorials).
